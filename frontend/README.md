# Build Audience Refactor.

My initial approach to building this application was not performing well because I had written the code as I deemed correct. There are a lot of redundat code to be
removed. Using webflows exported code was not a good idea because it does not have the flexibility to be customized once the code is exported. On top of that incorporating the webflow code to react was a hassel.
This refactor will be aimed mainly at improving the readability of the code, removing redundancies and following the best practices of coding.
